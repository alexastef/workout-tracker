# Workout Tracker
Full-stack workout tracker built using MongoDB and Mongoose


## Description
Workout Tracker is a full-stack web application using a MongoDB database and Mongoose ODM. This was a bootcamp assignment for which all the frontend code was already provided; however, the frontend needs quite a bit of work in order for this app to function as it's supposed to. I plan to improve the functionality by improving the frontend and only recommend doing a similar project if you have the time and/or capability to revamp the frontend.

## Installation  
 
    npm i  

Dependencies for this app are Express, MongoJS, Mongoose, and Morgan. I also recommend using Nodemon.

## Usage  
As I mentioned above, this app needs further frontend development to be fully functional. You'll want to review all the files and folders to understand what each file is doing. I started with the server. From there built the Workout model based on the seeds that were provided. Last, I created the html and api routes based on the given routes in the API.js model. 

To start application, run npm start or node server.js:  
 
    npm start  
 



## Tests  

    npm test

## Challenges  
The starter code for this assignment was disorganized and poorly written,  which made it difficult to focus on the backend development. I did two different variations of this assignment and both had similar issues. The put request is not called correctly in the frontend.

Beyond that, I've gotten pretty comfortable working with a SQL database and Sequelize ORM, so shifting to NoSQL took some adjusting as well.

## Future Development  
The app is missing the functionality to be able to add exercises to an existing workout / continue a workout with additional exercises. I would like to adjust the frontend so that each workout can have more than one exercise in it. My routes are modified from the original version of this exercise.
